# Base Ruby

This is an empty project for you to create and run Ruby files.

Run your Ruby file by typing `ruby ` and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

Say we create a file called `hello.rb` and want to run it, we can write the command:

```bash
ruby hello.rb
```

To re-run this command, you can use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to look at the history of all commands you've run in a particular Terminal.
